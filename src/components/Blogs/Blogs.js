            <p>An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party <br/> developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.<br/> This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface.<br/> Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services. <br/>API use has surged over the past decade, to the degree that many of the most popular web applications today would not be possible without APIs.</p>
